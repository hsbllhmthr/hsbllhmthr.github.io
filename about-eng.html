    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Yolooo what's up guys 🖐, let me introduce myself, I'm Hasbullah Dedat
      Hasbala M (the 'M' is my family name, Mathar). I was born in Ujung Pandang
      city, which is now better known as Makassar city. Currently, I'm in the
      final stage of completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science 👨‍💻
      at Alauddin State Islamic University in Makassar. Fortunately, my passion
      for technology goes hand in hand with my major.<br />
      <br />
      Since I was in elementary school, I have been interacting with PCs or
      computers that still use old versions of Windows, such as Windows XP or
      Vista. My interest in tinkering with computers continued with hobbies in
      graphic design (multimedia), which led me to participate in competitions
      during high school 🪑.<br />
      <br />
      My dislike for mathematics made me end up in this major, but it was a
      decision I made to pursue Computer Science.<br />
      <br />
      During my college years, I got to know many people who are involved in the
      IT industry. I realized that this field is much broader than I had
      previously imagined and that my knowledge was still far behind theirs. It
      was during that time that I got to know some application developers, and I
      took it as a lesson to develop my skills in the IT industry<br />
      <br />
      I learned a lot from various communities 👨‍👦‍👦 of application developers
      including the
      <span class="desc-about"
        >Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) by Google Developers</span
      >
      and became part of the Core Team from 2022 to 2023. After participating in
      various GDSC activities, I also took part in events organized by the
      <span class="desc-about"> Google Developer Groups (GDG) Makassar</span>.
      <br />
      <br />
      During my college years, I received several scholarships in various forms,
      one of which was a scholarship in the IT field called
      <span class="desc-about"
        >Bangkit Academy 2023 By Google, GoTo, Traveloka Google Cloud ☁ Learning
        Path</span
      >
      which greatly helped me to learn about the world of technology and
      application development. Bangkit is a career readiness program aimed at
      producing highly skilled technical talent for world-class Indonesian
      technology companies and startups, fully supported by Google, GoTo, and
      Traveloka. Bangkit has successfully trained 6,400 students from all over
      Indonesia. <br /><br />
      In addition to my studies, I also entered the professional world, and
      alhamdulillah, I was able to earn money 💸 as a programmer and graphic
      designer since the beginning of my college years at elfatafoundation.com.
      I was responsible for several features and mostly handled the design for
      the media creative team and still working as a freelancer to get side
      jobs.
